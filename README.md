## Description of the bot

The chassis design that we chose is designed for speed. This bot will include gear ratios as well as a transmission to increase and decrease speed when necessary. We will use a two gear transmission, first gear for torque and acceleration, second gear for maximum speed. The body will be rectangular, and we will attempt to make it as slim as possible. The bot will have four wheels, though the actually driving will be primarily two wheel drive. This is because a bot designed for speed will not need great steering.

Here is a general build of our chassis. Again it will be mainly speed based which the slim build shows.
