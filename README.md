# Nash's Robotics Portfolio

## Description of the bot

The chassis design that we chose is designed for speed. This bot will include gear ratios as well as a transmission to increase and decrease speed when necessary. The body will be rectangular, and we will attempt to make it slim. This is because a bot designed for speed will not need great steering.

Here is a general build of our chassis. Again it will be mainly speed based which the slim build shows.
